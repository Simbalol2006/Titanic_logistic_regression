# Titanic_logistic_regression
my first ml model to predict the survivors in titanic disaster dataset in kaggle

I will be posting the ipynb file that i submitted to kaggle

It is also the file in which i practiced numpy and pandas , by working on the data provided in the kaggle 

this is the link to the problem in kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/code/abhigyanpendyala/titanic-data-simba

This is one of my first projects, but i will continue to post.

The first results showed an accuracy of 75.119% giving me a rank of 11549.

which is bad  but this was my first submission.
